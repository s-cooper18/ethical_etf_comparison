# Ethical ETF Comparison
There exist several ethical Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) available on the ASX, however, what does it mean for a fund to be declared ethical? What differences are there between the different funds in terms of performance, composition and fees?

Here, I am to explore the differences between these through the analysis of data available on:
* The ASX website - list of current ethical ETF offerings
* ETF provider websites - for the composition and companies obtained in each
* Yahoo finance - for historical performance of each ETF

I will be using this as an opportunity to practise the following skills:
* Data scraping
* Analysis of financial data
* Visualisation of data
